# screentones
screentones can be bought and applied to drawings
that are like a translucent sticker that can be cut
into shapes with a screentone knife or a simple utility knife
then rubbed onto the page. the only downside is that
they are expensive.

You don't have to buy and apply premade screentones you can
simply practice drawing the background effects by hand to reduce
cost and create unique backgrounds finding how many
background are done by hand vs using pre-made screentones
depends on goals and constraints.
   
could print your own, but would have to look into this more
using digital could apply screentones/background effects digitally again would need to explore this more
 will update these notes in the future when I learn more about
 it.


## effects by hand or screentone:
If there is an appropriate screen tone use it.
if not do it by hand.
The right screen tone will not always be around you will need to learn how to do it by hand.


can grey out or shade before applying screentone

to apply put sheet over page and cut generously around items and then hold the piece down and cut out unnecessary parts
lightly. use back of a spoon or deleter to rub it on.

pick and choose what to use screentones for, careless use will make the page messy.
reccomends to not use screentones of background scenes as it's a wasted opportunity to practice by hand and relying on screentones will slow down progress.

don't force yourself to draw screentones if you can't draw 
it yourself scraping screentones 

scraping screentones technique layer posting practice to master scraping technique when scraping screen tones remember
the knights move a 45 degree mesh tone is one that looks greay with all the small dots lined up a typical screen tones in#61 in order to scrap it at 75 degree angle the scraping direction
should be a knights move focus on screen dots go two dot up one to me left or right scraping it this way will give it a natural looking blend remeber to clean off scrapes or they will stick to the next layer scrape against the direction of the grid if it's a 45 degree mesh grid scrape at a 75 degree angle

screentones can be applied to pannel lines too
but don't use them at random think of the overall page and be deliberate 
other wisse it gets messy.
can be used for caption borers the outline of the screentone pasted over the entire pannel works as the pannel outline


## advanced screentoone techniques
basics of screen layering, 
you can get different geometric designs (mories)
by changing the angle at which you layer the screentones try layering tones at different angles.
you can create patterns from a screen with a utility knife or sand eraser
