# size & density
## correlation between size and density in a drawing
- large drawings need details or end up looking sparce
  they can fit more visual information 
- small drawings require simplification or end up looking messy
- try drawing a close up in a pannel and then in a whole page
  to see how size effects how you draw differently in terms of 
  detail or visual density
