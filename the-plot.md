# the plot
To start creating note down the different events you have in mind example, theme: help make food for hungry people
All of the cooks went on vaction main finds a hidden cook book
learn enough to make simple meal and start making them for the people

- A plot is also known as a synopsis is an overview of the
- story.
- There is no one right way to write a plot.


Could use character dialogue some drawings and could be
a tool to visualize the story.
some props make a list others chunk descriptions for events and draw line to represent layout of the page write in a way that help you grasp the flow.

important aspect in story making is to eliminate unessary events creating plot is the most important step.

In creating a story create manga, that is both interesting and
easy to understand.

wheather a story is understandable or not depends on the order 
it's told/presented.

Think of a structure that will be understandable for the audiance during plot and story board phase.
Even if the story is fun if it's hard to digest people might not read it.
Don't rely on dialogue too much focus on order and tempo, difficult task though.

# masami takeuchi's 7 points of story writting
1. create a theme: a simple one that can be sumed up in one word
2. add some flavor through props and genre
3. create a stage where the main character can
   really showcase her appeal
4. the thing you want to write about most is the main event
5. you must create obstacles for the main character to
   make things interesting
6. create a lively story through an
   introuduction, development twist conclusion
7. create the backbone of the story through a plot


difference between close ups and long shots is good
when a long shot and a close up coexist on a page the close up is accentuated giving the scene depth

## carefully look at a profesisonal manga
can help with a beautiful setting.
check how lines are abbreviated in smaller drawings
compared to big ones big drawings need screentones effeects or other considerations or it'll look like something is missing

## organize the story into pannels:
success of characters and story depends on structure.
organize the story based on plot.
structure is the story's compostion.


## belonging to a genre
- gives the story appeal to a fan of the genre and
  expose people new to it.
- can use a prop such as a musical instrument to develop a genre
