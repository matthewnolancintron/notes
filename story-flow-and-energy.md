# story flow and energy
- the leads change in emotion gives the story energy
- story organization and flow are key to it's creation.

## think about the story's structure such as climax, intro, development, conclusion:
- ### introduction:
    - where you find out the kind of story it is.
- ### development:
    - what happens to the main character (growth)
- ### climax:
    - the main event unexpected event that can be described 
      as however or though, a big twist like a change of heart.
- ### conclusion:
    - what ends up happening the result

## can repressent these elements as a curve
