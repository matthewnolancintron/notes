# what's a storyboard
others should be able to undersatnd your storyboard.
stordyboard is a rough rough draft.
It clearly shows the flow of the story.

- Some write the name of characters on faces to help
  differentiate between the outlines.

- as a newbie try to draw complete pictures
  the more you draw the better you will get,
  thik of it as practice.

## the two parts of a storyboard
1. lines of dialoge
2. rough, rough draft aka the picture content

check page divisions,
pacing clarity.

thin high quality b4 paper is good for storyboards


## the pacing 
manga's appeal is determined by how good or bad the pacing is.

prioritize pacing over convsersation
a trick to imporve the pacing is not answer what the ohter is aksing eliminating agreeable responses in a conversation can shave off lines and improve pacing don't mold the conversation to the person your conversing with
structure is about how interesting it is.
liven up pacing by shaking off unnecessary parts

## the dialoge:
in manga sentences should be short and to the point.
don't rely toom much on dialogue such as characters feelings and situations when creating the storyboard think if it can be done through the drawings instead of dialogue the drawings should always in motion

### monologues:
long lines should be divided into short easy to read sections.
long lines are a pain for the reader keep it short and if lines can't be shortened then divide them into smaller parts with different ballons if they are really long have extra pages and pannels using both words and action another effective way to maintain readers attention is to split scenes do your best to avoid long subtitles or lines of dialogue.
monologues should be restricted to the lead avoid overusing them
and keep them short.

## how to read ballons: (configuration) 
Top right to bottom left for japanese manga
and top left to bottom right for western comics

### making ballons 
Use pen for ballon and pencil for dialogue.
ballons should be considered parts of the illustration
try to develop an original ballon that fits both the page and scene's mood.
The shape of the ballon can experss different voices and mindsets
normal conversations, unvoiced, thoughts, shouting, excited
insight, heart pounding, sniffle.

## dividing the pannels:
Only use different pannel shapes for special ocassions.
The simpler the ballon the better basic square pannel is fundamental before using a different pannel shape thinks about the pages balance and aesthetic when placing it.
its all about balanace and energy
different panel shapes are effective when used for big and main scenes.
avoid putting similar sized characters in similar sized frames.
add energy to the page and don't let the reader get boerd pannels should be easy to read and the page should be lively

## how to draw spreads and bleeds:
the spread is the drawings layout across any 2 pages think of the overall spread during writing especially during storyboarding
how will their eye move where should your illustration be position to make them jump out to the reader
think of this when arranging pannels to make a nice page read your work as a memeber of the audience to master the art of page turning

margin is the inside of the page between the spine and print everything else is bleed don't draw or place dialogue on margins or bleed

```

A. draw scene that graphs readers attention
B. put in a big scene
C. the scene here should make the reader want to turn the page
Think about the effect of the page turner when creating hte storyboard such as the readers reacing heart before the next page and passage of time 

## the page turner
Is a way to present your manga that makes the audience
excited about turning the page if you can get the audience to want to see what happens next it could be said your layout is a success 

pay attention to the readers point of view when reading manga asorb what kind of mechanism are working to make it interesting think of manga as your textbook the page turner can clarify the passing of time and scene changes.
layout doesn't need to be look at as something difficult. bottom line make it look interesting.

master format can allow you to continuously trick without being obvious.

## summary of format:
find different ways t oimprove layout design.
to improve format be exposed to lots of different formats
manga,movies,novels anything that has a story format
how should it be sequence for a reader friendly presentation
check out different works to expose yourself  to good and bad examples is great way to learn don't just draw manga all day make sure to be exposed to a variety of works.

### the seven format commandments:
1. always make a storyboard
2. eliminate excess pannels and liven up pacing.
3. make dialogue short and easy to digest
4. do not overuse monologues
5. pay attention to ballon shapes and reading sequence
6. make sure the pannels are dived in a lively way
7. always think of spread when writing storyboard and think of page turn presentation

camera work that cordiantes character point of view
using a method of switching between the character pov and the scenery can help the audience grasp of the situation.
when using this format you can draw a close up to maintain a sense of immediacy the readers lines of vision moves from right to left in manga attack that move in this direction can give it vigor placing the one under attack on the left give a sense of urgency many of the leads characters scenes follow a right left pattern

look into going from storyboard to a draft.
also what's a manuscript?

start with a rough draft on the manuscript before adding ink to rough draft and page layout.
remember simple is best for the rough draft and makes inking it later easier.
Also it should be drawn within a soft touch using a b or 2b pencil is helpful this will help erasing later on.

pay attention to page layout which is deciding where each pannel goes.
draw attention to the pannel you want to emphasize means some pannels get sacraficed using the bleed for panels gives a dramtic effect think about what you want to emphasis when thinking of page layout

## the composition
- learn about the following: low angle, high angle, long shot,
canted shot, high angle.
composition is how things are set up in a pannel
a composition is the energy of the page.
each composition has it's purpose up-shots used when 
to show characters expression longshot for showing the bigger scene low angle can highten tension very important to think of what you want to express in each pannel, and apply the appropriate composition a canted shot will amke the scene more exhilarating while a high angle gives an isolated feel comosition makes a huge difference in the overall feel of the work you can learn a lot about composition from watching movies check them out.

## pen stroke:
### inking rules:
1. be deliberate with each line
2. add line contrast 

### the scene isn't flat.
use a pen at least once a day to get used to it.
distant lines should be fine, close up lines should be thicker, those are the basics. 
On characters main lines should be thicker edges and creases should be done with a fine stroke.



## filling in 
### adding white
erase pencil lines and mark areas.
long bruch for delicate areas and marker 
or brush pen for the large areas liquid ink for filling 
in use with brushes don't use drawing ink with brush try different inks use a pallette or paint dish to think out white ink before use
white inks for filling in places.
can do a stary sky, highlight eyes, add creases to black clothes
pay attention to it's dilution, if it's too thin you can
see through it.
