# events

## main event
- page count matters,
- could think of dedicating half the number of pages
  to the main event.
- if you use too little pages it won't leave a lasting impression

### what do you want to depict, what kind of event do you need to express
- create a storyboard after carfully concidering all of that.

- it's also important to think about how to draw 
  the main event which is the theme

## secondary event
- all non main events should build up the main event
- building to the main event from previous events
  creates excitment and moves the audience
- secondary events are a struggle to the main
- elimantion process is more important than creating events
  when writing the story.
