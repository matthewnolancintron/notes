# creating main characters
- scenarios that make the reader root for the character

- think of the type of lead character you would root for

- making lead's personality appealing and who the lead is should be obvious to make empathizing easier


## the story you want to draw is essentially your theme
- What the writer wants to say and 
  what the main character feels becomes your theme.
- Think of a theme that will warm the heart of the readers
- find one word for the theme:development,friendship, love
  are examples of a theme each could be a drama or adventure
- add originality you can create and make it more interesting
  set up the genre and have points that can only be enjoyed in your manga
