# perspective

## point perspective
get a specialized book on perspective look towards a book on architectural drawings when drawing a room in 1 point perspective be careful of the comparative size of the objects in the room even if perspective is used correctly all is ruined if the objects sizes are off


## two and three point perspective
- don't start drawing from the vanishing point, everything will look unbalanced.
- try drawing a low ceiling, wide hall and big lights.
- the key to deciding the height of the vanishing point it should be adjusted to the height of the person looking at the scene use perspective for both characters and background
- you can add vanishing points outside of the page.
- trying using 3 point perspective.
