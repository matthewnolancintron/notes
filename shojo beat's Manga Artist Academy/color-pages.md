## tools fo color pages
clean water is important for doing color pages you'll need lots of water when coloring get a lot of water in a large bowl and reduce when dirty also clean tools and brushes
for best coloration use colored ink luma dr martin pelikan and nouvel are popular brands

also uses brushes and a droper can help mix the colors more precisely a plastic brush cleaner and a china bone pallet ink and paper check out the following holbein water resitant ink pigma pen sepia colored maxon ink water pigment pen called procolor 2 also try to blend holbeins sepia and black ink with color you like

eve nwith water resitant ink wait until it dies before coloring at least a day

for coloring pages you can use water color paper, canson, mermaid, arches or bb kent may work out well.

could draw then trace to a pieee of water color paper
so you can redo if you mess up you can use/ try different paper depending on the color they all have a different feel check illustration board its water color paper secured to a thick board which helps prevent the paper from getting soggy when colored

## color order and white ink
start with light colors the darker colors tend to bleed such as the color red must finish by layering the lighter colors especially when your not used to color it's foolproof that way
do a test run on a small piece of the watercolor paper before you start because the color on the pallet will look different than the color on the paper. wash brushes often and use clean water
some use differnt brushes for skin colors blue based colors and red based clors decide ahead of time which color goes where only paint the next section after the previous section
has dried.

the key to a beautiful finish is layering light colors such as skin tone look better if you adjust not by using differnt colors but by layering a single one use the method for effects like high lights the benefit of layering is that you can't tell if the light colors spill outside the lines a little
this way there is less chance you will mess

another basic rule is to make sure you only color the next area after the ink's dried.
first brush water on skin areas it's called dampening usually 
start with the skin if you get the skin tone right you basically succeded with the color page.

before the water from the dampening dries put some carfully chosen skin color on the brush and make sure to remove excess ink with a tissues 

start brushing from the sides the way when the color is too dark you can spread it inwards spread layer by layer also finish with white if need for things like a sparkle in the eye and your done be careful with the white just becuase its white doesn't mean you can fix it speed is key

## special effectss and air brushing
### airbrushing
master this for unique color pages the first step in airbrushing is masking put masking sheets and massking tape on the parts you don't want to airbrush.
